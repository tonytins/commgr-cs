Commission Manager is a cross-platform graphical terminal application keeping track of commission and YCH transactions. The information can later be imported into databases or modified externally from a spreadsheet program.

This is still a major work in progress. Contribution to the project is most welcome.

<!-- ## Planned Release Cycle

Commission Manager will be following a release cycle where for each new stable branch that is made, the previous one will go into Long-Term Support (LTS) while the current one will be the standard (Interim) release. The following next release will then become the new LTS.

This approach will allow for a stable version of the software to be available for users who prioritize stability over new features, while also allowing for new features to be introduced in the standard release for users who prefer to have the latest updates. -->
